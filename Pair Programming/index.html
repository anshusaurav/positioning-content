            <p>Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) The space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.

            <p>You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be huge deal in these first examples, but...

            <p>Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.
